# Kubeservice stack Code of Conduct

## Purpose

Kubeservice stack pledges to foster an open and welcoming community, to make our projects,
events, and community inclusive to the largest number of contributors and
participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such,
the participants in Kinvolkâ€™s projects pledge to be committed to providing a
friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, physical
appearance, disability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion (or lack
thereof), level of experience, education, nationality, ethnicity, gender, or
sexual identity and orientation.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in
our projects and community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable
behavior.

We invite all those who participate in our projects to help us create safe and
positive experiences for everyone.

## Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open
[source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and
strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our
community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is
essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that
exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is
welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the
fullest extent, we want to know.

## Expected Behavior

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the
  health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your communication and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Give constructive feedback.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior.
* Be mindful of your fellow participants. Alert the project leaders if you
  notice violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, trolling, abusive,
discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning communication or actions by any
participant in our community online, at all related projects and in one-on-one
communications carried out in the context of community business.


Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related
to gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, disability; inappropriate
use of nudity and/or sexual images; inappropriate depictions of violence;
deliberate intimidation, stalking; unwelcome sexual attention.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including corporate
participants or sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be
tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the project leaders or
Kinvolk may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a
temporary or permanent ban from participating in the project and community
without warning.

## If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
concerns, please report it by contacting Kinvolk at conduct@kinvolk.io.

## Addressing Grievances

Conduct, you should notify Kinvolk at conduct@kinvolk.io with a concise
description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with
our existing governing policies.

## Scope
