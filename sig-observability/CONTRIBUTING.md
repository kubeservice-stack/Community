# Contributing to SIG Observability

Welcome to contributing to SIG Observability. We are excited about the prospect of you
joining our [community](https://github.com/kubeservice-stack/Community/blob/main/sig-observability)!

SIG Observability is responsible for the components that make Cluster Operation and Maintenance decisions.
You can read the SIG mission outlined in the [charter](https://github.com/kubeservice-stack/Community/blob/main/sig-observability/charter.md).

There are multiple ways you can participate, including PRs, issues, documentation, new proposals,
helping to answer end-user's questions, attending meetings. All kinds of contributions are welcomed.

## Before you begin

We strongly recommend you to check out the [kubeservice Contributor Guide](https://github.com/kubeservice-stack/Community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

## Best Practices

The community has been following some practices to help ensure maintainable and quality code:

* Leave the Reviewers assigned by the bot automatically if possible, unless there is a need
for a specific contributor's expertise.

* Critical bug fixes can be assigned to approvers directly.

* Always add a new commit to address review comments instead of amending. This helps to
review the new changes. You might be asked by the Reviewer to squash at a certain point.

* Squash the commits when the PR is ready to merge, this does a great favor for the git history.

* Code contributions should be relatively small, simple, well documented and well tested.
Try to split your changes into incremental PRs if the feature is big.

* Whatever discussed offline or at the community meeting should be recorded back
to the issue/PR, which helps to preserve the context.

* Always open an issue for a TODO or a follow-up just in case you forget it.
